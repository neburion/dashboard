"""fleet-status collector — one machine's state, as JSON, once every 30s.

Runs as root on a timer and writes $FS_OUT. Nothing in here ever reads a
network request: the file is handed out by a separate unprivileged unit
(serve.py), so the privilege needed to list another user's systemd units and
read syncthing's API key never sits behind a socket. Root collects; nobody
serves.

Every section is wrapped. A probe that raises records {"error": "..."} rather
than taking the whole report down with it, because a dashboard has to tell
"nothing is wrong" apart from "nobody asked" — and a section that simply
vanished would read as the first one.

Times are unix seconds, sizes are bytes. No formatting happens here; the page
that draws this knows what a human wants better than the box does.
